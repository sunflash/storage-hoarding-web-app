# storage-hoarding-web-app

A litter script to expose storage horading "web app" using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), [Chromium Embedded](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef) and [Edge WebView 2](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef).
So more people can "motivate" desktop app developers or company, make them switch to better alternative like [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) or [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)

Every app use these frameworks (Electron, Chromium Embedded, Edge Web View), occupy 200-400 mb disk space each just for the frameworks.
Most people would consider it as waist of valueable disk space and unnecessary bloat.

Script works on mac.
